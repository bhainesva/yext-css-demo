- css nesting needs tailwind compat thing: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting
- editor support needs postcss extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss
- pxtorem doesn't seem to work
- Clickable component prop handling is wrong, forex baseClass gets added to element as an attribute


Guides: 
- HH/TEMs should use tailwind for everything
- We should use .container to replace our helper
- We should use css grid for everything
- Use your best judgement on when to use utility classes vs when to write css
	- For me, I wouldn't put responsive styles (beyond visible-xs/hidden-xs type things) in html


One significant change is that you can't use css that's tied to a component you're not using. That is:
- you will write a Heading.scss class, but unless you're using Heading.tsx somewhere that css will not be bundled. 

Questions:
- should you reference things as variables or through the tailwind theme?
- should we use apply?
